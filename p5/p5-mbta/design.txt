There are two classes that implement Runnable, P_thread and T_thread. 

Within each are a run() method. Within each run method a lock is obtained on a Station via synchronize().

For the T_thread, representing a Train, that lock waits until the next Station is free. Then T_thread
obtains the lock for the current Station. Afterwards, for both locks, notifyall() is called.

For the P_thread, representing a Passenger, if they are at a station waiting then the lock for the
current station is obtained. If they are on a train, then the lock for the next station on their
journey is obtained. In both cases, wait() is called until the right train or station is available.
Finally, notifyAll() is called after locks are released.

Unfortunately, there seems to be deadlock as the program runs out of time on Gradescope.
